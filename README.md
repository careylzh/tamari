Tamari is a light spatial meditation experience designed for short, restorative breaks, reimagining mindfulness through the novel sensation of guided eye movements in physical space. Inspired by MEMI’s calming eye movement patterns, Tamari adapts them into interactive, shape-based visual flows that extend far beyond the confines of a traditional 2D screen. 

Utilising the full spatial capabilities of Apple Vision Pro, these patterns are overlaid onto the user’s surroundings, engaging a wide range of vision and fostering a sense of embodied presence. 

By recognising and responding to the architectural features of a space—such as walls, floor intersections, alcoves, or skywalks—Tamari generates personal “rhythm landscapes” that encourage gaze patterns across varied spatial depths. Grounded in research indicating no single optimal shape for anxiety or trauma relief, Tamari’s framework integrates diverse, user-personalised shapes for symbolic resonance. 

Each session concludes with a self check-in, modelled after post-therapy treatment flows, promoting emotional awareness and reflective practice. Through these artefacts, Tamari explores the untapped potential of repetitive, spatially-guided eye motion as a means of relaxation, offering a fresh approach to micro-moments of mental wellness.
